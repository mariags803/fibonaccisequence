# Code kata: Fibonacci


## Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number
is calculates adding the two previous numbers. This sequence begins 
with two numbers: zero and one. The third number is calculated 
adding these two numbers (0 + 1). The fourth number is calculated 
adding the two numbers before it (1 + 1). And so on.


Having a position, the function returns the value that corresponds 
to that position in the Fibonacci sequence.
